# Welcome to **Dodeci-XII** 🚀

This is a repository full of random web applications, created for the sole purpose of wondering **why** we even bothered to build them in the first place 🤔

## Who we are 👾

We are a team of French developers 🇫🇷, not aspiring to be anything extraordinary, just here to code and convince ourselves we’re more than just IT students 💻

## Our goal 🎯

Our aim is simple: to create tons of repositories filled with **all** our ideas 💡. We just want to have fun, build silly things, and entertain anyone who stumbles upon them 🎉

## For what purpose? 🧐

We don’t want fame, we don’t want money, and we definitely don’t want anything else… like I said, we’re just here to make fun things for fun people. **That’s it** 😎🎈
